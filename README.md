# RANDOMFLIX

RANDOMFLIX is a movie recommendation system that randomly selects a movie and then suggests movies that are similar to the selected one.

## Overview

This project utilizes a dataset of movies and their features to provide recommendations. It employs a similarity-based approach to suggest movies that have similar characteristics to the one randomly selected by the user.

## How it Works

1. **Random Movie Selection**: The system randomly selects a movie from the dataset to serve as the starting point.

2. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the features of the selected movie, the system calculates similarity scores with other movies in the dataset. It then suggests a list of movies that are most similar to the selected one.

3. **Display Recommendations**: The recommended movies are displayed to the user, along with their posters retrieved from an external API.
